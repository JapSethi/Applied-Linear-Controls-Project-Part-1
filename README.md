# Applied-Linear-Controls-Project-Part-1
**To develop and validate an empirical discrete-time state-space model of the dynamic system using [system identification](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ident/gs/about-system-identification.html) methods**

**Note**: For this project, we assume that nothing specific is known about the system dynamics; however, we do know that it has two outputs and one input, and we know that the system is open-loop stable.

#### Objectives Achieved: 

- Constructed an excitation signal for System Identification following the satuaration limit for DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)
- 


- Modeled MIMO dynamic systems using state-space techniques.
- Analytically and numerically solved for the dynamic response of any linear dynamic system and relate the response to the state-space system description.
- Analyzed the open-loop and closed-loop stability of any state-space representation.
- Designed linear state-feedback controllers using pole placement techniques.
